# My Allocated Budget App

This project is based on the **Allocated Budget example by IBM**, licensed under Apache 2.0.  

I have **completely rewritten the code**, added new features, and customized the interface to improve usability and add personal enhancements.

## Features

- Fully rewritten React front-end.
- Custom UI with improved usability.
- Uses libraries like Bootstrap, ag-grid-react, react-select, and react-imask.
- WebView-ready for Expo / React Native mobile builds.
- Local storage and unique ID management.

## Getting Started

### Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/RomanWalhalla/AllocatedBudget-AppEasExpo.git
